Research on Speech-to-Text Models

Abstract:

Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability of a machine or program to identify words spoken aloud and convert them into readable text. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary and might only identify words and phrases that are spoken clearly. More sophisticated software can handle natural speech, different accents and various languages.
Speech recognition uses a broad array of research in computer science, linguistics and computer engineering. Many modern devices and text-focused programs have speech recognition functions in them to allow for easier or hands-free use of a device. They differ from text-to-speech systems, in which the system analyses text content and converts the text into spoken audio.

Introduction:

Speech recognition software must adapt to the highly variable and context-specific nature of human speech. The software algorithms that process and organize audio into text are trained on different speech patterns, speaking styles, languages, dialects, accents and phrasings. The software also separates spoken audio from background noise that often accompanies the signal.
Methodology: To meet these requirements, speech recognition systems use two types of models
Acoustic models: These represent the relationship between linguistic units of speech and audio signals.
Language models: Here, sounds are matched with word sequences to distinguish between words that sound similar.
